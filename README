This is nobunobuta fork from CyanogenMod

Most of my modification is adding Japanese resoureces.

To initialize get started with Android/CyanogenMod (nobunobuta fork), you'll need to get
familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, 
use a command like this:

repo init -u git://github.com/nobunobuta/android.git -b donut

Then to sync up:

repo sync


After checking out the repositories, you'll need to create a
buildspec.mk file with contents like this:

TARGET_PRODUCT:=cyanogen_dream_us
TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT:=eng
TARGET_BUILD_TYPE:=release


For additional instructions on getting the necessary proprietary
files into your build, and to get things going from here:
